Meeting 12/3/20

Focus: Wave 0 + Wave 1


Wave 0 had a very low CTR, signaling insta as a better platform.

Wave 1: Data Protection was rejected.
  Data Protection and Advocacy produced best results
  Creative: All Over needs more spotlight, at least more insights before waving it off. Data Footprint and Made Clear are probably not worth continuing running and should be avoided in terms of similarity.
