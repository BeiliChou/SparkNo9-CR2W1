Meeting 12/3/20

Focus: Wave 0 + Wave 1


Wave 0 had a very low CTR, signaling insta as a better platform.

Wave 1: Data Protection was rejected.
  Data Protection and Advocacy produced best results
  Creative: All Over needs more spotlight, at least more insights before waving it off. Data Footprint and Made Clear are probably not worth continuing running and should be avoided in terms of similarity.
  
  Talking about what the ad portrays to the consumer, product vs activity.
  
  Landing page interaction would probably help define more of ^
  
  
  Add emotional column to DF!
  
  
  Survey? Could help define what each ad is seen as by each consumer. 
  
  Emotional ads are probably garnering some type of community/active response vs a product solution. Could the same demographic be receptive to the product instead? Could the ads be reskinned for more clarity while maintaining the emotional aspect?
